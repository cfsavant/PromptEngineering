# Red Flags: When to Be Skeptical

🚩 AI can't provide citations or provides dead links

🚩 Very specific statistics without sources (e.g., "73.4% of users prefer...")

🚩 AI is extremely confident about something you doubt based on your expertise

🚩 The output perfectly agrees with your stated preference (possible sycophancy)

🚩 Technical claims you can't verify (check the actual documentation)

🚩 Subtle word differences that change meaning (e.g., "supports multiple languages" vs. "requires multiple languages for third-party apps")

🚩 AI answers contain internal contradictions
