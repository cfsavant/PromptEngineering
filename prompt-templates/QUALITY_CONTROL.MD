# Quality Control: Before Accepting AI Output

## ✓ Accuracy Check
- Can I verify this information?
- Are there citations or sources?
- Does this match what I already know?

## ✓ Relevance Check
- Does this actually answer my question?
- Is it appropriate for my specific context?
- Did it misunderstand what I was asking?

## ✓ Completeness Check
- What's missing?
- What assumptions is it making?
- What context does it lack?

## ✓ Quality Check
- Is this actually useful or just "sounds good"?
- Would this survive scrutiny from an expert?
- Does it add real value or just word count?
